            For Whom The Bell Tolls - Ernest Hemingway, 1940

I liked it, not exceptionally, but it was worth my time.

Took longer to read than I expected, pace is a bit slow and so my attention wandered more often than usual.

Was surprised by the slow pace and contemplative rhythm, very introspective for the most part. When I picked up the book I thought I was getting into a fast paced thriller that could palette cleanse all the roundabout, romantic stuff I usually read; but it ended up running closer to my usual tastes than I expected. Theres still definitely a lot of new material for me to chew on though, as the setting and content were still pretty unfamiliar to me. I'm reminded again of how little conflict I've ever been exposed to, which I could do with being a lot more grateful for.

One of the reasons I've always strayed away from being interested in war media is that it feels hard to be mindful and respectful of the very real struggles that took place without romanticising war or indulging in nationalistic ideas. It's hard to know how much of the history I've been taught is based on old propoganda. I felt that Hemingway managed to walk the line here well - almost certainly he had enough personal experience to draw on in order to build a mature perspective. Much of the book dwells on Robert Jordans opinion on various aspects of war, and I assume Hemingway is mostly inserting his own ideas here.

I have conflicted thoughts on the necessity of violence. Being from the UK most of our modern wars seem to be imperial wars (and most of our historical wars too). For the most part I've felt that I wouldn't join the military on account of disillusionment with our government and our cause. I guess there are situations though where it would make sense to fight. The Nazis, or Fascists in general, are very easy enemies to hate and a war opposing them definitely is easier to sign up for than some 21st century effort to secure cheap oil or whatever. In our current political climate violence is seeming more and more justified, ultimately necessary, to instigate any real change. Although of course violence is only justified when its for the politics *I* believe in, and barbaric otherwise. I don't know. I find it interesting that Jordan isn't really so political and self-describes as just 'anti-fascist', it makes him easier to get behind as a more 'everyman' protagonist, but I do think it avoids the question a bit. Like I mentioned earlier, fighting Fascists is a bit of a get out of jail free card for considering the ramifications of violence.

Anyway, lots of food for thought and I'll spare you rest of my rambling on that subject. Haven't really got a very clear position to begin with.

The romance plot does feel indulgent to me, there are definitely elements of misogyny and white-saviourism, but given the period and the realities of war I think there is more license for indulgence. The interpersonal dynamics were charming even if there wasn't an electric chemistry, and the charm was necessary for the story. While the war themes engaged me intellectually there wasn't a real emotional investment, and although the romance wasn't particularly interesting it was definitely necessary to give the story's emotional gut punches some weight.

Prose style definitely stands out, accessible but unusual. Generally simple sentence structure but long run-on sentences, at points 'stream of consciousness'. Dialogue seemed stiff on account of the Spanish to English translation, I'm not sure how much of the style is due to this and how much is just Hemingway, and the self-censorship gets a bit distracting. I wouldn't say I had any problems with the prose but I think I'd enjoy more to read a version that has been uncensored, and if I was ever fluent enough I'd definitely be interested in reading the original Spanish text. I imagine its a better reading experience.

I feel like theres probably more for me to say but I can't think of anything else particularly right now. I guess I'll get better at that as I write more of these, for now I'll summarise. I liked For Whom The Bell Tolls. It has a very narrow and immediately apparent scope, and it really takes its time to wind across and explore it. Its fiction but very grounded in the real on account of the historical setting and Hemingway's experiences. I'd be interested in reading more of Hemingway's work, I hear its a bit more upbeat, but it'll probably be a while before I get round to it.
